Let's go full god-mode. Here's how we execute **all four** steps and build a truly **self-optimizing AI agent** that retrains itself from its failures — like a SaaS cyborg.

## ✅ Step 1: 🔁 **Auto-Correction Retraining Scripts**

### 🔧 Script: `generateCorrectedReply()`

```ts
export async function generateCorrectedReply({
  originalPrompt,
  aiReply,
  agentReply,
  failureExplanation,
}: {
  originalPrompt: string;
  aiReply: string;
  agentReply: string;
  failureExplanation: string;
}) {
  const prompt = `
An AI assistant gave the following reply:

Original Prompt:
"${originalPrompt}"

AI Reply:
"${aiReply}"

An agent corrected it to:
"${agentReply}"

The failure explanation was:
"${failureExplanation}"

Rewrite the AI reply to match the agent’s tone, accuracy, and completeness — without copying it. Improve the original reply to avoid the same failure.

Only return the improved reply.
`;

  const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.3,
  });

  return result.choices[0].message.content?.trim();
}
```

### 🔁 Loop over all failed replies and store improved versions.

Store in DB:
`ai_reply_improvements (original_reply, corrected_reply, prompt_id, score_gain_estimate)`

---

## 🏆 Step 2: 🔢 **Leaderboard: Most Improved Replies**

### Create Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_reply_improvements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  prompt_id UUID,
  original_reply TEXT,
  corrected_reply TEXT,
  score_gain_estimate INT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Estimate `score_gain` by difference between old vs new rating.

### UI:

* Table: columns → Prompt, Old Reply, Improved Reply, Score Gain
* Optional column: Link to training prompt or message context

---

## 📦 Step 3: **Export JSONL for OpenAI Fine-Tuning**

Each row in `ai_reply_improvements` can become:

```json
{"messages":[
  {"role":"user","content":"<originalPrompt>"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"<corrected_reply>"}
]}
```

### Script: `exportJSONL.ts`

```ts
const fs = require('fs');

const rows = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM ai_reply_improvements`);

const lines = rows.map(row => {
  return JSON.stringify({
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: row.original_prompt },
      { role: "assistant", content: row.corrected_reply },
    ],
  });
});

fs.writeFileSync("training_data.jsonl", lines.join("\n"));
```

→ Ready to upload to OpenAI via CLI or API.

## 🧠 Step 4: **Integrate Cluster Insights into Training Prompts**

Use `failure_category` when building your prompt:

```ts
const prompt = `
You are replying to a customer support message.
Based on past failures, this type of query often fails due to: "${failureCategory}"

So be especially careful to avoid issues in that area.

Customer message:
"${customerMessage}"

Reply as a helpful assistant.
`;
```

Now you’re **context-aware at training-time and inference-time**.

## 🚀 You Now Have:

* Auto-generated **improved replies**
* Leaderboard of the **most fixed** messages
* Export pipeline for **OpenAI fine-tuning**
* Training prompts that adapt based on **failure clusters**
