- Cache cleanup scheduled hourly
- Deep optimization performed every 6 hours
- Daily performance reports generated
- Auto-scaling recommendations when load exceeds thresholds

### 4. Monitoring & Alerts
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Memory usage alerts at 85% threshold
- API response time monitoring (1000ms threshold)
