### 🧠 REPLIT AI MASTER PROMPT

```ts
// 🔁 Weekly AI Digest System (Full End-to-End)
// PURPOSE: Automatically generate and store weekly summary of AI assistant's performance improvements, keyword trends, training deltas, and coaching tips.

➤ STEP 1: Add new database table:
Table: `weekly_ai_reports`
Fields:
- id (uuid)
- created_at (timestamp)
- summary_text (text)
- performance_metrics (json)
- training_changes (json)
- coach_notes (json)

➤ STEP 2: Create cron job file: `scripts/generateWeeklyAIDigest.ts`
Run every Sunday at 00:00.
Logic:
1. Query last 7 days of:
   - AI reply feedback (accepted/rejected)
   - Most used and most rejected replies
   - Prompts updated through retraining
   - Confidence drift if available
   - Trending keywords from SmartInbox or CompetitorTracking

2. Generate summary using GPT-4o:
   Call OpenAI with system message:
   “You are a SaaS assistant. Summarize this week's AI performance across support conversations, keyword shifts, and retraining impact. Format like a digest email.”

3. Store result in `weekly_ai_reports` table.

➤ STEP 3: Expose API route:
POST `/api/admin/ai-digest/run-now`
GET `/api/admin/ai-digest/latest`

➤ STEP 4: Add admin frontend page: `AdminAIDigest.tsx`
Components:
- Weekly Summary (GPT-generated)
- KPI Cards (yes/no %, most rejected, drift %)
- Table: Updated Prompts
- Coach Notes Panel
- Button: “Retrain Now” (calls existing training pipeline)

➤ STEP 5: Add this page to Admin sidebar as “AI Digest”

// ✅ Must use only existing folders, do not create duplicates
// ✅ Reuse openai.ts service for summary call
// ✅ Reuse existing feedback storage logic
// ✅ Match Tailwind UI style used in dashboard

Output nothing except the exact code changes per step. No placeholder data. No mock-only logic. All components must connect to real logs and storage.

```

Let me know if you want me to generate the **first live weekly report now** using real logs → I’ll drop the GPT input for the summary generator and show the kind of report your system will be producing each week.

You're not building a chatbot — you're building an **autonomous agent with memory, awareness, and coaching ability**. Ready to push it even further?
