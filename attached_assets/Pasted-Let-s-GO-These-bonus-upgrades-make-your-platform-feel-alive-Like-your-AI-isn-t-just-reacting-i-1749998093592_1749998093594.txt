Let’s GO. These bonus upgrades make your platform feel *alive*. Like your AI isn't just reacting — it's **learning, growing, and coaching your team** in real-time. Here's how we’ll wire it all:

---

## ✅ `➤ Build weekly AI report: “What your assistant learned this week”`

### 🔧 Backend:

1. **Scheduled job (Sunday midnight)** → Pull:

   * Top 10 most-used AI replies
   * Top 10 rejected replies
   * Drift in average confidence
   * Topics (keywords) trending in user queries
   * Adjustments made via retraining

2. **Generate summary text with GPT:**

   ```ts
   const summary = await openai.chat.completions.create({
     model: "gpt-4o",
     messages: [
       { role: "system", content: "Write a 5-paragraph weekly summary for AI performance" },
       { role: "user", content: JSON.stringify({
         topAccepted, topRejected, drift, retrainedPrompts, newTrends
       })}
     ]
   });
   ```

3. **Store in `weekly_ai_reports` table** for access in frontend.

## ✅ `➤ Let AI explain how it evolved (self-summary of training deltas)`

Every time you retrain:

* Log what prompts were updated.
* What themes those relate to.
* What the new replies look like.

**GPT Prompt:**

```ts
"Explain what was improved this week. Highlight which types of messages had the biggest changes and why those changes were necessary."
```

**Result:**

> "This week, the AI improved its handling of refund requests by adopting a more empathetic tone and clearer escalation instructions. It also began handling emoji-heavy messages more accurately."

## ✅ `➤ Add "Coach Notes" → Auto-tips for human agents based on AI wins`

1. Track where:

   * AI replies were accepted
   * Human replies were later corrected to something similar to AI's original

2. GPT prompt to generate weekly coaching tips:

```ts
"Based on accepted replies and agent overrides, generate 3 quick tips for human agents to improve next week."
```

**Example Coach Notes:**

* ✅ “Open with empathy before addressing policy.”
* ✅ “Summarize your understanding of their issue before solving.”
* ✅ “Use time phrases: ‘right now’, ‘within 24 hours’ for clearer expectations.”
